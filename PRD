6.2.2. AI Model Training and Fine-tuning:
The application shall leverage pre-trained Gemini Pro models, with capabilities for domain-specific fine-tuning where appropriate and feasible.
Fine-tuning shall focus on: Sales and customer support terminology, Industry-specific language and concepts, Organization-specific processes and workflows (if customer-specific fine-tuning is supported).
The application shall support continuous improvement of AI models based on user feedback (explicit and implicit) collected through the application (as per 5.1.6.5, 5.4.3.6).
Training and fine-tuning data, especially if sourced from multiple customer CRM systems, must be anonymized, aggregated, and handled according to strict data privacy, security requirements, and user consent.
6.2.3. Performance Requirements:
AI processing shall complete within acceptable timeframes to ensure a responsive user experience for typical usage scenarios. (Specific timings like "< 2 seconds" were removed based on user feedback; "acceptable" needs to be defined through testing and user feedback).
The application shall provide clear visual indicators to the user during AI processing.
Background processing shall be utilized for operations that could otherwise negatively impact UI responsiveness, ensuring a fluid user experience.
Performance metrics related to AI processing times and system responsiveness shall be continuously collected and analyzed. These metrics will inform ongoing optimization efforts and help refine what constitutes "acceptable timeframes."

Data partitioning strategies shall be implemented for application databases as needed for performance and scalability.
Data retention policies for application-specific data shall be configurable according to business requirements and regulations.
6.3.2. Data Retrieval:
The application shall implement efficient data retrieval mechanisms for both its internal data stores and for accessing data from connected CRM systems and document repositories.
Caching strategies (e.g., for frequently accessed CRM data, user preferences, configuration) shall be used judiciously to improve performance and reduce load on external systems, while ensuring data freshness.
Search functionality within the application (for notes, documents, etc.) shall be optimized for performance and relevance.
Data pagination shall be implemented for displaying large data sets in the UI.
The application shall support both synchronous and asynchronous data retrieval as appropriate for the use case to maintain UI responsiveness.
6.3.3. Data Backup and Recovery:
The application's managed data stores (application databases, object storage for AI artifacts, etc.) shall be subject to regular automated backups.
Backup frequency and retention periods shall be configurable and align with business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) plans. RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) targets must be defined.
Point-in-time recovery (PITR) capabilities shall be supported for critical application databases where feasible.
Disaster recovery procedures for the application and its data shall be documented and regularly tested.
Data integrity checks shall be performed periodically and as part of backup and recovery operations.
(Note: Backup/recovery for data residing within connected CRM systems is the responsibility of those CRM providers/customers).
6.4. Security and Compliance (Based on user's original PRD, aligned with strategy)

6.4.1. Data Protection:
The application shall encrypt sensitive data both in transit (e.g., using TLS 1.2+ for all communications) and at rest (e.g., using AES-256 or stronger encryption for application databases and stored files). Cloud provider key management services (KMS) should be utilized.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) obtained from users or connected systems shall be handled strictly in accordance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, and others as applicable).
Data masking or anonymization techniques shall be implemented for sensitive information when used in non-production (e.g., development, testing) environments.
Regular security assessments (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability scanning) shall be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the application and its infrastructure.
6.4.2. Access Control:
The application shall implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) for its own functionalities and data.
The principle of least privilege shall be applied to all user roles and system service accounts.
Access to administrative functions and sensitive AI configuration settings shall be strictly controlled.
For data accessed from connected CRM systems, document repositories, or calendar platforms, the application shall always operate within the permissions granted by the authenticated user for that specific external system and shall not enable privilege escalation.
Session management for the AI application shall include appropriate timeout mechanisms, secure token handling (e.g., JWTs), and protection against session hijacking.
Failed authentication attempts shall be monitored, and appropriate account lockout policies shall be applied to mitigate brute-force attacks.
6.4.3. Audit Logging:
The application shall maintain comprehensive and tamper-evident audit logs for security monitoring, compliance, and troubleshooting purposes.
Audit logs shall include, but not be limited to:
User authentication events (logins, logouts, failed attempts).
Data access and modification events (especially for sensitive data and configurations).
Administrative actions performed within the AI application.
System configuration changes.
Integration activities (e.g., connections established/failed with CRMs, significant data sync events).
Key AI agent actions performed on behalf of users (e.g., email drafts generated, tasks created).
Access to sensitive documents or PII.
Audit logs shall be stored securely and protected against unauthorized modification or deletion.
Log retention periods shall comply with company policies and relevant regulatory requirements.
Tools or mechanisms for analyzing audit logs should be available for security monitoring and compliance reporting.
6.4.4. Compliance Recommendations:
The application should be designed and built with controls to support compliance with major data protection and privacy regulations, including but not limited to:
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Economic Area.1   
1.
data-policy.thepdfmaker.com
data-policy.thepdfmaker.com
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) / California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) for users in California.
Other relevant regional or industry-specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA if handling healthcare-related information, though not explicitly scoped here).
The system design should facilitate data subject rights (e.g., access, rectification, erasure) for data managed directly by the application. For data mastered in connected CRMs, these rights would typically be handled via the CRM itself.
6.5. Recommended Technical Architecture & Stack Considerations
(This section was detailed in the previous response, outlining Architectural Principles and Proposed Technical Stack Components: Cloud Platform (GCP recommended), Frontend (React/TS), Backend (Python/FastAPI or Node.js/NestJS), AI/ML Layer (Gemini via Vertex AI, Vector DB), Data Layer (PostgreSQL, NoSQL option, Object Storage, BigQuery), Integration Layer (Connectors, Message Queue, API Gateway), and DevOps & Operations tools. The caveats about this being a high-level recommendation apply.)

7. Non-Functional Requirements
(This section would typically detail NFRs like Performance (specific metrics beyond AI processing), Scalability, Availability, Reliability, Usability, Maintainability, Security (specific standards beyond compliance), Internationalization (i18n) / Localization (l10n). We've touched on some of these, but they'd be formally defined here.)
